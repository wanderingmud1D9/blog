This blog is to serve as a publishing platform through which I\nam able to readily advocate for the usage of open source privacy technologies,\nBitcoin, and Monero.</p>\n<p>While I am going to attempt to refrain from engaging in political discourse\n(this is reserved for a separate, but related, blog), there are perhaps a few\nessential points which it might be best to clarify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I fully and actively support the right of all citizens to freedom from\nsurveillance by state and federal governments. Additionally, this often times\nintersects with advocating against the usage of products and services offered by\nmultinational corporations. This includes (particularly now), the right to\nprivacy regarding one’s own medical history. No institution or organization\nshould be endowed with the authority to mandate medical procedures for any citizen.\nRecords of the medical histories of citizens should also, obviously, never be\nused to restrict one’s freedom of movement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I assert that the right to property is essential to the survival of\nsovereignty at the level of each individual citizen. As such, I am wholly and\nentirely opposed to Marxism, state-collectivism, and most leftist-inspired social\nphilosophies. There may be few exceptions regarding possible tolerance for left-wing\nmarket anarchism, but I simply not well-versed enough in these movements to comment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The right to self-defense (including the ability to bear any and all means of\ndefending oneself, innocent members of a community, or private property) is\nalso a right I consider to be critical to full citizen sovereignty.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Western civilization has yielded extremely bountiful and beautiful works of\nart, literature, philosophical traditions, and aesthetic movements. The\npreservation and protection of these (along with those innocent citizens of\nthe western world) is sacrosanct.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you very much for your interest, and I look forward to future posts addressing\ntechnical topics.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Instantiating a new blog","date":"December 31, 2021","description":"An introductory post for this new platform"}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"56f41407-fa5d-5d25-9db7-3659208c21d3","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},
