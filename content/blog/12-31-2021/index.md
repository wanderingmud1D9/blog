Hello everyone. This blog is to serve as a publishing platform through which I
am able to readily advocate for the usage of open source privacy technologies,
Bitcoin, and Monero.

While I am going to attempt to refrain from engaging in political discourse
(this is reserved for a separate, but related, blog), there are perhaps a few
essential points which it might be best to clarify:

* I fully and actively support the right of all citizens to freedom from
  surveillance by state and federal governments. Additionally, this often times
  intersects with advocating against the usage of products and services offered by
  multinational corporations. This includes (particularly now), the right to
  privacy regarding one's own medical history. No institution or organization
  should be endowed with the authority to mandate medical procedures for any citizen.
  Records of the medical histories of citizens should also, obviously, never be
  used to restrict one's freedom of movement.

* I assert that the right to property is essential to the survival of
  sovereignty at the level of each individual citizen. As such, I am wholly and
  entirely opposed to Marxism, state-collectivism, and most leftist-inspired social
  philosophies. There may be few exceptions regarding possible tolerance for left-wing
  market anarchism, but I simply not well-versed enough in these movements to comment.

* The right to self-defense (including the ability to bear any and all means of
  defending oneself, innocent members of a community, or private property) is
  also a right I consider to be critical to full citizen sovereignty.

* Western civilization has yielded extremely bountiful and beautiful works of
  art, literature, philosophical traditions, and aesthetic movements. The
  preservation and protection of these (along with those innocent citizens of
  the western world) is sacrosanct.

Thank you very much for your interest, and I look forward to future posts addressing
technical topics.
